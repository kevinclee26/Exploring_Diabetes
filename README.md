# Exploring_Diabetes
## The goal of this project is to create a dashboard to visually explore the Diabetes dataset
data was obtained from: [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes)

### Before any Machine Learning projects, it's imperative to look at the data and perform some analysis and assess the soundness. I find that visually looking at the data definitely helps in getting a better understanding of what is being provided. 

This is a very popular dataset for people who are interested in Diabetes or health management in general. I've built some functions to make it easy to look at the data after some data wrangling. Additionally, you might find useful use cases for the below tricks: 
- transforming long dataset to a wide dataset
- using datetime as index
- custom legend
- stacked bar charts

### Here is a sample output for one submission (out of 70 people):
